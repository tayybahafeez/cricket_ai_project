## Executive Summary

This report presents the development and evaluation of a machine learning model for predicting T20 cricket match outcomes. The model achieves 82% accuracy using a Random Forest classifier with engineered features, providing both predictions and human-readable explanations through LLM integration.

## 1. Problem Statement

**Objective**: Predict whether a chasing team will win a T20 cricket match based on current match statistics.

**Business Value**: 
- Real-time match outcome prediction for betting/fantasy sports
- Strategic insights for team management
- Enhanced fan engagement through AI-powered commentary

**Success Metrics**:
- Accuracy > 75%
- F1-Score > 0.75
- Interpretable predictions with explanations

## 2. Data Analysis

### 2.1 Dataset Overview
- **Size**: 15,687 match instances
- **Features**: 4 original + 2 engineered features
- **Target**: Binary classification (won/lost)
- **Time Period**: T20 cricket matches

### 2.2 Data Quality Assessment

**Strengths**:
- No missing values
- No duplicate records
- Realistic value ranges for all features

**Issues Identified**:
- Some negative values in `balls_left` (data entry errors)
- Extreme outliers in `target` scores
- Imbalanced dataset (65% win rate)

**Preprocessing Decisions**:
- Removed rows with negative `balls_left`
- Capped extreme target values at 99th percentile
- Applied filtering: `balls_left < 60` AND `target > 120`

### 2.3 Exploratory Data Analysis Insights

**Key Findings**:
1. **Late Innings Pressure**: Win rate drops from 75% to 45% when `balls_left < 30`
2. **Wicket Impact**: Teams with ≤2 wickets win 75% vs 45% for teams with ≥6 wickets
3. **Target Difficulty**: Win rate decreases linearly with target score
4. **Run Rate Correlation**: Current run rate shows strong positive correlation (0.68) with outcome

**Visualizations Created**:
- Outcome distribution analysis
- Correlation heatmap
- Win rate by balls remaining
- Win rate by target score
- Scatter plot: runs vs balls left

## 3. Feature Engineering

### 3.1 Original Features
- `total_runs`: Current score of chasing team
- `wickets`: Wickets fallen
- `target`: Runs needed to win
- `balls_left`: Balls remaining

### 3.2 Engineered Features

**Current Run Rate**:
```python
current_run_rate = (total_runs / balls_played) * 6
```
- **Rationale**: Standard cricket metric for scoring rate
- **Impact**: Strong predictor (correlation: 0.68)

**Required Run Rate**:
```python
required_run_rate = (target / balls_left) * 6
```
- **Rationale**: Required scoring rate to win
- **Impact**: Pressure indicator (correlation: -0.45)

**Safety Measures**:
- Division by zero protection
- Infinite value handling
- Outlier clipping
